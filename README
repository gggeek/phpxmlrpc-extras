PHP-XMLRPC Extras
=================

## AUTHORS:
    Gaetano Giunta

## DESCRIPTION:
    A collection of extensions, addons and other stuff that might be
    of use for development of xml-rpc (and jsonrpc, soap) based applications

## REQUIREMENTS:
    PHP 4.2 or newer
    php-xmlrpc 2.1 or newer

## API DOCUMENTATION:
    HTML documentation can be found in the doc/ directory.

## COPYRIGHT:
    Use of this software is subject to the terms in license.txt (except for
    the code in the adodb directory, which is dual licensed under BSD and LGPL)

## INCLUDED PACKAGES:

### ADODB:
    Provides an easy mean of connecting applications to remote databases using a web service protocol instead of a
    native database driver.

### AJAX:
    Demo of ajaxified version of xmlrpc lib: supports executing xmlrpc/jsonrpc calls
    directly from the client browser.
    Needs the excellent jsolait lib from http://jsolait.net/ (thanks Jan Kollhof)

### DOCXMLRPCSERVER:
    Subclass of xmlrpc server that self-generates HTML documentation of exposed services.
    Easy as a breeze to use, and extremely user-friendly.

### JSONRPC:
    Support for this brand new trendy protocol, 100% buzzword-compliant and ajax-ready.
    Client and server classes provided.
    Makes it very easy to build a server that supports both protocols at the same time.
    Original JSON parsing code from Michal Migurski (whose lib is now officially part of PEAR).

### PROXY:
    Subclass of xmlrpc server that can act as remote (transparent) xmlrpc proxy to forward calls to a remote server.
    Can either forward any received call or probe remote server first for existing methods.

### WSDL:
    The completely UNOFFICIAL DTD and RELAX NG schemas to validate your xmlrpc against.
    Might be useful in defining some wsdl file describing xmlrpc services (good luck!!!).
    The DTD is not quite accurate, due to limitations in the definition language.
    RELAX NG should be 100% precise and accurate.

### XMLRPC_EXTENSION_API
    Provides drop_in support for th php native xmlrpc extension, for when your code depends on it, but you can not
    install it on the server.
